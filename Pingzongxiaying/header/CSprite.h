//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Notes on defines and variables:
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*	

	The following defines are used to terminate an animation sequence.
	The codes tell the game what should be done after the last animation 
	frame has been displayed.

	LOOP_ANIMATION       - Loop current animation until further notified.
	GOTO_NEXT_ANIMATION  - Change animation state to the sate number stored next in the array.
	MAINTAIN_LAST_FRAME  - When the animation sequence is finished, keep blitting the last frame of current animation.
	GO_INACTIVE          - When the animation sequence is finished, the sprite should go into a standby mode and wait.
	DESTROY_SPRITE       - When the animation sequence is finished, destroy the sprite by removing it from the linked list.

	Notes on Member Variables:

	m_chType              - Identifies the sprite's type. (i.e. ship, enemy, bomb)
	m_chName              - Unique identifier for the sprite. (i.e. player1, player2, levelBoss)
	m_nState              - Identifies the sprite's current state. (i.e. normal, powered-up, exploding)
	m_nID                 - Simple numerical identifier for use by the programmer
	m_dPosition_x         - Sprite's x coordinate position on the screen.
	m_dPosition_y         - Sprite's y coordinate position on the screen.
	m_dVelocity_x         - Sprite's velocity along the x axis.
	m_dVelocity_y         - Sprite's velocity along the y axis. 
	m_bVisible            - Is the sprite visible or not?
	m_bDestroy            - Should the sprite be removed from the linked list?
	m_bCollide            - Should collision detection be performed on this sprite?
	m_bAutoAnimate        - Should the sprite animate itself or will the programmer do it manually?
	m_bActive             - Is the sprite playing an active role in the game or is it in stanby?
	m_bScripting          - Is this sprite currently under script control?
	m_bModifyCollision    - Will the size or shape of the collision area be modified before collision detection is performed?
	m_bSingleFrame        - Does this sprite consist of a single frame and has no animations?
	m_nFrameRateModifier  - Either a negative or positive number whic is used to slow down or speed up the frame rate for animations.
	m_nFrameWidth         - The width of each frame that makes up the sprite's animation.
	m_nFrameHeight        - The height of each frame that makes up the sprite's animation.
	m_nFramesAcross       - The number of frames per row in the bitmap.
	m_nFrameOffset_x      - If the first pixel of the sprite's first frame is not located in 
	                        the upper left corner of the bitmap, you must give the first pixel's 
						    actual x coordinate position or the frames will not be extracted 
						    correctly.
	m_nFrameOffset_y      - Same as above, but holds the y coordinate position.
	m_nWidthScaling       - The number of pixels to increase or decrease the sprite's width by when blitting
	m_nHeightScaling      - The number of pixels to increase or decrease the sprite's height by when blitting
	m_nCollisionTop       - The number of pixels to increase or decrease the sprite's top for collison detection
	m_nCollisionBottom    - The number of pixels to increase or decrease the sprite's bottom for collison detection
	m_mCollisionLeft      - The number of pixels to increase or decrease the sprite's left side for collison detection
	m_mCollisionRight     - The number of pixels to increase or decrease the sprite's right side for collison detection
	m_nCurrentAnimation   - The index number of the animation sequence that the sprite
						    is currently using.
	m_nCurrentFrame       - The frame within the animation sequence that the sprite is 
						    currently using.
	m_nAnimations[]       - An array of pointers to int arrays where the frame numbers that 
	                        make up an animation sequence will be stored.
	m_nFrameCount[]       - Keeps track of the number frames per animationn sequence.
